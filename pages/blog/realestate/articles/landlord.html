      <p>
        It's not uncommon for tension to arise between tenants and landlords.
        However, the possibility of argument is something that can be avoided.
        In this article, youâ€™ll get advice on how to handle the most frequent
        types of conflicts between tenants and landlords.
      </p>

      <h2>Solutions to Common Landlord-Tenant Problems</h2>

      <p>
        You, the landlord, are aware of the many challenges that lie ahead.
        Tenant management may be challenging, especially when dealing with
        problematic renters. Whether you're an experienced landlord or not, you
        can easily learn how to better handle the most common complaints from
        tenants. Here are some solutions to common landlord-tenant problems.
      </p>

      <h2>Late or Non-Payment of Rent</h2>

      <p>
        Late payment or no payment at all is one of the biggest problems that
        arise between landlords and tenants. Most landlords say that renters who
        pay their rent late or who don't pay at all are the most frustrating
        tenants to deal with. Tenants who don't pay their rent on time or at all
        may have valid excuses. There might have been difficulties in paying the
        rent, disagreements with the landlord, or simple forgetfulness. However,
        like with so many other issues, effective communication is necessary for
        both parties to find a solution. To prevent this kind of problem, always
        verify that the renter has been made aware of the total amount owed and
        the date by which it is due. If your rent is consistently late, you
        should have a conversation with your tenant about the issue. You can
        even try to be of help by providing a payment plan that works within
        their budget.
      </p>

      <h2>Issues With Maintenance</h2>

      <p>
        Make sure the lease explicitly states the responsibilities of each
        party. On frequent occasions, landlords often pay for necessary repairs.
        If a tenant approaches you about a maintenance issue, for which you are
        responsible, you should respond quickly. Assure them that their feedback
        has been heard and that they will be updated as the situation evolves.
      </p>

      <h2>Appliance Failures</h2>

      <p>
        If regular appliance maintenance and repairs are part of your contract's
        terms, you must uphold your end of the agreement. All of the property's
        appliances will need to be maintained by you. If any of the appliances,
        whether or not they were included with the property, break during the
        lease term, the renter is responsible for the expense of repair or
        replacement. However, this does not mean that broken appliances should
        be disregarded and tenants permitted in. Look around the inside and
        outside of the house for any evidence of damage. It is essential to fix
        any broken appliances before a new renter moves in.
      </p>

      <h2>Breaching Agreement</h2>

      <p>
        The lease agreement contains the rules that the tenant must follow.
        Restrictions on things like noise, dogs, and curfews all fall under this
        category. Regrettably, some tenants disagree that the rules are
        necessary but most tenants are generally kind people who never cause any
        trouble. However, even the most careful tenants sometimes forget
        something or damage something. Tenants who break the rules should be
        given a written warning specifying when the issue must be resolved. Any
        penalty for failing to comply such as eviction should be made crystal
        clear.
      </p>

      <h2>Property Damage</h2>

      <p>
        The most upsetting issues that might arise between landlords and tenants
        are related to vandalism. Unfortunately, some tenants may intentionally
        cause damage to your property in the days leading up to their departure.
        Even worse, they may pretend nothing has happened and attribute damage
        to the condition they met it in. If you want to prevent this problem,
        you need to start taking action right away. Do a walkthrough inspection
        of the property before renting it out. Collect a signed photo release
        from the tenant verifying the rental's condition. After the renter has
        moved out, you should re-inspect the property and take new photos as
        evidence of its condition. Time and date stamps should be put on all
        images taken during the move-in and move-out inspections.
      </p>

      <h2>Overdue Utility Bills</h2>

      <p>
        Tenant and landlord disagreements over utility costs are not uncommon.
        In your leasing agreement, you need to specify who is responsible for
        what expenses. Utilities may be in the landlord's name, but even if the
        lease holds the tenant liable for payment, the landlord cannot enforce
        payment.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Tenant Screening is Important</h2>

      <p>
        Tenant-landlord conflicts are a common cause of stress during a tenancy.
        The good news is that most of these problems may be avoided with
        thorough tenant screening. Problematic tenants are individuals who are
        late with their rent payments, cause numerous maintenance issues,
        repeatedly break the conditions of their lease, and leave without paying
        their last energy bills. However, comprehensive screening may be able to
        weed out the bad apples. Tenant screening, in addition to taking care of
        maintenance issues, collecting rent, and being compliant with the law,
        may be a time-consuming and laborious process but it will save you from
        much trouble in the future.
