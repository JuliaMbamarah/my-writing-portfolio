          <h1>Introduction</h1>

          <p>
            The problem with production today is the inability to recover an
            optimal amount of the discovered resource. From statistical
            analysis, only about 60% of oil is recoverable, and the highest
            amount recorded so far is only 80% of the discovered oil. That is to
            say that about 25% of oil still exists in oil field wells that have
            been abandoned.
          </p>

          <p>
            Obtaining data from various oil fields in Canada, the I.O.I.P was
            computed using Deep learning. The network was trained to predict the
            given volume of oil initially in place. A sensitivity analysis of
            the neural network model generated revealed which input parameters
            contributed majorly to estimating the I.O.I.P.
          </p>

          <p>
            From the information deduced, an Ideal well would be one whose
            determinant factors are minimized or maximized according to
            parameter alteration feasibility. The Prototype was optimized by
            improving the determinant properties of interest. A data update
            subsequently led to further training and an improvement in the
            degree of recovery attainable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inasmuch as other energy sources are being identified, oil and gas
            still remain an integral part of the energy industry, and steps to
            ensure that recovery of this energy source is optimized to the
            greatest percentage must not be neglected.
          </p>

          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

          <p>
            Several properties of a reservoir, a few of which are the porosity,
            permeability, compressibility, and saturation, are used to make
            analysis through calculations, correlations, graphical
            representation, etc, and to subsequently draw conclusions hence
            establishing new attributes to the reservoir. These core properties
            of the reservoir are obtained through Core analysis and Wireline
            logging. These are both data collection procedures that enable data
            to be extracted from the reservoir.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are certain mathematical methods that have been used in the
            past, some of which are still in use to establish relationships
            between several data variable types and to establish new dependent
            variables in the form of information. In Reservoir Engineering,
            several correlations have been developed for various purposes
            ranging from the determination of a reservoir’s bubble point
            pressure to the critical properties of the reservoir. Algebraic
            Equations in the form of Volumetric equations and Material Balance
            equations have also been developed and assigned for estimating some
            properties of the reservoir.

        <h2>OPEC as a Global Business Influencer</h2>
        <div id="abstract2" class="abstract-content">
          <h1>History of OPEC</h1>

          <p>
            In 1960, during the time of decolonization and creation of many new
            independent states across the developing world, government officials
            from the five founding countries of OPEC met at the Baghdad
            conference held from 10th-14th of September, to discuss strategies
            to secure the best price of crude oil available for major oil
            corporations. This was in response to the MOC unilateral action of
            cutting down oil prices. Its headquarters was originally set up in
            Geneva, Switzerland, but after five years, the location was changed
            to Vienna, Austria. The five founding countries of OPEC in 1960
            include: Iraq, Iran, Venezuela, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.
          </p>

          <h2>Aims and Objectives</h2>

          <p>
            OPEC was set up as a means to devise strategies to challenge the
            problem being brought about by the Multinational oil companies.
            Known as the ‘Seven sisters’, MOC used to monopolize the oil market.
            The aims and objectives of OPEC include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              To ensure price stability – In the absence of OPEC, Individual
              Oil-producing countries in the bid to compete with each other, set
              lower prices as well as maximize production, resulting in more
              global demand leading to unsustainable depreciation of natural
              resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              To reduce oil price volatility – OPEC ensures that the price
              target is being met by setting a limit and an excited target for
              daily production to ensure that there is no fluctuations in supply
              that could lead to volatility in oil price.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adjust world oil supply – For oil shortage due to occurrences in
              some parts of the world OPEC ensures there is increased production
              in other parts to meet up to global energy production
              expectations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Update</h2>

          <p>
            In the light of the global pandemic state of the economy in the
            earlier months of 2020, the world experienced a general decrease in
            Oil demand.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              DOC participating countries agreed to hold monthly OPEC and
              Non-OPEC Ministerial meetings, ONOMM, to evaluate market
              conditions and decide on production adjustments for subsequent
              months. The 15th and most current ONOMM meeting took place via
              video conference on the 1st of April where adjustments to
              production levels were made and countries with overproducing
              volumes were sanctioned. In addition, ways to reduce greenhouse
              gas emissions were reviewed.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 180th and most recent meeting of the OPEC conference on the
              global oil demand decrease in the second wave of the pandemic and
              the forecasted growth by 2021. OPEC also celebrated its 60th
              Anniversary since its founding in Baghdad, 1960.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>OPEC and Canada</h2>

          <p>
            Back in 1973, when OPEC placed an embargo on oil production, it was
            targeted towards five countries: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, United
            Kingdom, and United States. Canada is the 4th world-largest oil
            producer; however, the industry has suffered low oil demand due to
            the COVID-19 pandemic. Its production costs are high, and it exports
            majorly to the United States at a heavy discount. The Canadian
            government is working hard to implement policies to help Oil
            producers rise from the price fall due to the pandemic. OPEC views
            Canada and the US in opposition to the goals of OPEC. During OPEC’s
            recent conference, it agreed to cut its Production to 9.7 million
            barrels per day, about 10 percent of the global oil supply. Canadian
            oil wells, however, will be mostly shutdown despite OPEC’s deal.
            Because Canada and other countries such as the US are struggling to
            increase the oil supply base and OPEC is regulating production to
            avoid excess supply and increase oil price, there exists a negative
            relationship between the Canadian Oil Industry and OPEC.
          </p>

          <h3>Arguments in support of OPEC:</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Weak Individual policy changes – Threatening policy changes to
              OPEC’s survival cannot hold even in the event of a change in
              leadership because new regimes are more likely to stand by OPEC to
              increase income rather than take short-term beneficial lone
              actions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conservationist outlook – This development was procreated through
              the gradual devolution of control over production policy from the
              international oil companies to the local government. The outlook
              is a shift from profit maximization, that is increased prices and
              production to profit optimization, that is stabilized outputs
              compensated by price increases.
            </li>

          <h1>Behaviourism</h1>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            Behaviourism is one of the four major theories of learning,
            propounded by John Watson in his classic paper, ‘Psychology as the
            behaviorist view it’, which was published in 1913. It is a learning
            theory that proposes the ideology that all behaviors are learned
            through an interaction with the environment in a process known as
            conditioning. It is concerned only with stimuli response that can be
            observed and discounts any independent activities of the mind.
            Behaviourism had evolved from the tradition of Empiricists who
            believed in objective and verifiable data. It was the dominant
            school of thought between the 1920’s and the mid 1950’s.

          <h2>Impacts of Behaviourism</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The behaviorist theory is employed even in the modern classroom.
              Students who perform well are rewarded for their good behavior
              through commendations, praises, and good grades. The impact this
              application has is to make other students strive for better
              performance. Examples of these include: rewards revisions,
              question and answer.
            </li>

            <li>
              In the same vein, students who do not perform well or who exhibit
              some attributes that are considered unruly will be punished in one
              form or another. The impact this has is to make students avoid
              circumstances that would result in those undesirable feelings.
              Examples of these include: scolding, detention, exclusion, and
              sometimes even isolation.
            </li>

            <li>
              It is employed in teaching students that the more they practice,
              the better their performance would be, and the more praise that
              they will receive for such high performance, in a form of
              reinforcement. The impact this has is to make students
