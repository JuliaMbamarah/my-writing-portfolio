              He walked in, more like he staggered in, running into the wooden
              table, displacing it slightly and causing a sound which would have
              not been so shrill if it were to have been bereft of the night,
              followed first by the clinking sounds of glasses running into each
              other and then finally a shattering sound which pierced deeply
              into the quiet of the night.
            </p>

            <p>
              He paused as if for a second realizing what had happened, and then
              slumped forcefully to the ground, lucky to have landed on the arm
              of the sofa. He smiled widely and foolishly as if he had just won
              a lottery, a lottery here of good sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Goodness me! Eric!”, A lady voice called out in something in
              between a disgust and a surprise.
            </p>

            <p>
              Felicia Madonna, highly beautiful, elegant, sophisticated and
              always contained one could barely see her in a state of
              distortion. Barely except when it came to her only son and real
              heir to the fortune of the old man. She was the wife to the late
              Mayor of the town of Geratine.
            </p>

            <p>
              “ Eric!! This is the height of it”, she mumbled walking hastily
              and haphazardly towards the couch where Eric laid with his arms
              and legs spread out widely. She stopped to get hold of a book
              lying on the middle glass table, and then hit him with it heavily
              on the head.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Owwww! What’s do you waant muuuummm, go awayyyy, I just miss
              Dad”, he managed to slur out.
            </p>

            <p>
              Felicia’s frown-tight face slowly sagged, turning to a sad one.
              She sighed deeply and sat down on the couch just next to the one
              in which Eric laid. She thought sadly and deeply. It had been two
              years since that ghastly accident that claimed the life of her
              husband.
            </p>

            <p>
              It had been an Easter Sunday, and he had gone in his new Peugeot
              104 together with Eric to buy things for dinner and have some
              father and son moment. She had been at home preparing things for
              their dinner and decorating the house. Just like every other
              Easter, it was bound to have been perfect. But why she had woken
              up having the weirdest vibes that morning is a story she knows now
              all too well. She realized something had gone wrong after waiting
              for another half-hour as to the time they were to have arrived.
            </p>

            <p>
              She’d picked up her cell phone and a bunch of keys, alerted their
              closest neighbor, and left in the other slightly rickety car they
              possessed, being thankful they hadn’t given it out yet. She had
              barely driven out of the street when she got a call. Her heart had
              skipped a beat when she saw her husband’s name on the Caller’s ID.
              It skipped even more beats when she had heard a strange voice at
              the end of the line.
            </p>

            <p>
              The last thing she had remembered was crying, and like lightning,
              she had been at the scene of the accident. She had prayed and
              hoped earnestly that the body being carted away to the ambulance
              had nothing to do with her. She walked hastily, highly unstably,
              crying profusely to the cart being pulled away. She couldn’t bring
              herself to raise the sheets, but when she eventually did, she fell
              on her knees and cried like she never had, being consoled by
              passersby who had stopped to catch a view of the scene.
            </p>

            <p>
              Apparently, there had been an accident, an oncoming trailer lost
              control and hit, more like squashed the Peugeot completely. When
              the bodies were recovered, her husband had been dead, while the
              boy was injured badly.
            </p>

            <p>The boy? Her son!!!</p>

            <p>
              She jumped up quickly just in time to see her son being carted
              away on a similar-looking stretcher. He was alive!! She sprung
              towards him. There was a glint of hope in her eyes, the tiniest
              bit of gladness in her heart.
            </p>

            <p>
              But when she looked into his, she saw a lifeless gaze, a gaze so
              distant, a gaze so cold…

          <h1>Chapter One</h1>

          <p>
            The first thing that had caught my attention as he walked into the
            classroom was his neck chain. Its round pendant had a crescent shape
            inscribed on it. It shone a dazzling silver, reflecting bright light
            as it caught at an angle. I had the same neck chain, only the
            inscription on mine was that of a full moon.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Not so fast, you have to introduce yourself to the class," Obiora
            had said.
          </p>

          <p>
            Obiora, once a timid, however brainy boy, was now the class monitor.
            He came back last two summer breaks transformed, leaving everyone in
            awe as to how. Our class teacher had no choice but to hand him the
            position of the class monitor, seeing how academic he was in
            addition to his newfound charisma.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Excuse me?" The new boy said, raising his perfectly arched brows as
            he stopped on his track just in front of the whole class.
          </p>

          <p>
            His skin blended surreptitiously with the wooden coffee-black
            furniture that graced the classroom. As he spoke, the auburn of his
            lips parted to reveal caramel white teeth. His broad shoulders
            housed a small black backpack that hung lazily from his right,
            slightly swinging back and forth across the side of his abs, which
            were ever so evident through the thin ash-colored shirt he wore. His
            head hung rather firmly over his neck, assuming the same level as
            that of the top of our whiteboard.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, like a pot of a mouth-watering delicacy infected with a
            drop of kerosene, or more so like a dot of black on a white canvas,
            he had this stony look to him, one that seemed to want to hide his
            pretty. Fortunately, it wasn't working.
          </p>

          <p>
            Obiora cleared his throat this time. "I said you have to introduce
            yourself to the class before you settle down."
          </p>

          <p>
            From all indications, Obiora was frightened. He was taking deep
            breaths more frequently than was normal. I give it to him for
            maintaining his composure and not stuttering on his words. The
            person in front of the class was terrifying. Although what most
            people found terrifying, I found intriguing. Amusing even.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Is it written somewhere in this handbook? They made me read it
            twice and I'm pretty much sure, I didn't come across anything of
            such," he said nonchalantly, earning snickers from most students.
            Even I found it amusing, although I didn't show it. However, his
            expression was still as stony as the time when he had walked into
            the class. Angry much.
          </p>

          <p>
            I went on with my accessing session, gazing yet again at the roughly
            patched dark auburn lips that had just spoken down to his chest. The
            long-sleeved t-shirt clung tightly to his shoulders, arms, and
            torso, revealing the muscles within.
          </p>

          <p>It wasn't a bad sight.</p>

          <p>
            I could make out Obiora still breathing in deeply from my side
            vision, but now with a furious look. He wasn't enjoying the episode
            and had obviously had enough. I anticipated his next line of action.
          </p>

          <p>
            "No, it's not written in the handbook, but it's only courteous and
            proper that before you walk into an unfamiliar arena that you're
            going to be constantly walking into for the next couple of months,
            the least you could do, and mind you I said least, is introduce
            yourself. It may not be in the rule book, but trust me, the teachers
            are well aware of it, you could decide to see it as a tradition that
            definitely you won't be the first to break," he poured out, raising
            his voice gradually as he spoke and gasped for air once he had been
            done.
          </p>

          <p>
            Boom! Mystery boy actually widened his eyes a bit but returned it to
            normal just as soon, no one else would have noticed. Well, except
            me. I'm pretty observant. I could see the tiniest bit of impression
            on his stony face.
          </p>

          <p>
            "The name's Jeremy," he finally admitted and continued on his track
            into the already crowded classroom. It was normal for new students
            to show up to the senior secondary class of students writing WAEC,
            especially in the first trimester of the academic term.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Just Jeremy? Okay, let's decide to accept that. So what school had
            you been transferred from?" Obiora continued. Now as innocent as
            this question may seem, people ask it for various reasons. One; they
            just really want to know where you'd been transferred from. Two; it
            gives them a feeling of superiority knowing what great school you'd
            left behind to be part of them. The more popular your school had
            been, the more pleasant the feeling. Three; They want to measure
            your worth from the school you'd last been at. So believe it or not,
            there exists a theme in the cartilage of the student's mind that
            goes; Rich if from a rich man's school, Poor if from a poor man's
            school. Four; They just really, honestly, want to know what school
            you'd transferred from.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I'd rather not say," and with that Jeremy, as he'd come to be
            associated with, scribbled his way to the very back of the crowded
            class.
          </p>

          <p>
            I let out a breath I didn't realize I had been holding. The aura and
            countenance to him felt completely out of the usual. I'm not the
            boy's type, neither am I the friendly type.
          </p>

          <p>Screw that.</p>

          <p>
            I used to be so friendly. I used to be much so friendly. Maybe a bit
            too friendly.
          </p>

          <p>
            There was a time when I was this easygoing fun-filled person, when I
            used to feel things, when I could feel love and love back in return,
            when I was happy. However, the term 'was' is used to refer to past
            actions.
          </p>

          <p>
            But then, Jeremy. I couldn't stop thinking about him throughout the
            day. I was constantly turning back, trying to catch a full view of
            him. I had seen that exact expression before. I had been well
            acquainted with the stories behind it, and they're not quite the
            pleasant type.
          </p>

          <p>
            They were the type of stories that make one lose belief in things
            they had believed firmly in. They were the type of stories that made
            even the brightest of colors fade slowly into the harsh shadows of
            the night, never to regain their vibrancy.

        <h2>The Black Gate</h2>
        <div id="story3" class="story-content">
          <p>
            It was 12:00pm. She knew she should be right then inside her home,
            in the comfort of her bed. She knew that the last place she’d wanna
            be was here. She crept slyly like a creature of the night under the
            bright illuminating glare of the full moon as she casted shadow on
            the rocky ground. She shuffled quickly into the shadows of what
            happen to be, as she turned around a wide black gate.
          </p>

          <p>
            The gate! She was met with a climax of alternate feelings. On one
            hand she was glad she’d finally found it, on the other hand she was
            scared she’d actually found it! Every ounce in her body screamed for
            her to run. And run, she was about to when she heard shuffling from
            the bushes to the path which she had just taken. The shuffling
            stopped just as soon as an even more upsetting sound of an engine
            took off. And right before her eyes emerged a Truck, from the blues
            of the bushes with headlights shining bright head-on. She ducked
            quickly and went to the far end of the gate where the path ended.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her heart now beat loudly and haphazardly as she watched the Truck
            successfully curve round the path out bushes with it’s back towards
            her some feet away. When the lights of the Truck went off and the
            door of the Truck clicked open, Asha jumped up slightly and dropped
            the torchlight in her hands, as it made a noise. She cursed silently
            underneath her breath.
