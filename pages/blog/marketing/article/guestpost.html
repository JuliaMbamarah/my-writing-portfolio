        How to Pick Quality website for Guest posting: 15 Metrics to check
      </h2>
      <p><small>Date: November 1, 2023 | Author: Julia Mbamarah</small></p>

      <p>
        Do not make the mistake that most people make in their quest to find a
        guest blog site. The most popular question I get is “What sites do I
        pick for guest posting?” Guest blogging is one of the smartest ways to
        get your name out there as a blogger. You write articles for a guest
        blog that contains links that direct back to your own blog. Since it
        requires a lot of time and effort, it can be frustrating when done
        wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are several metrics to check in picking quality websites for guest
        posting:
      </p>

      <h2>#One – The site’s relevancy to your business niche</h2>

      <p>
        A big waste of your time as well as energy would be pitching to sites
        whose content is unrelated to your niche. This is a common mistake
        amongst new bloggers who want to build a backlink profile. You must
        navigate the website and find out if its goals, content as well as the
        target audience align with that of your own website.
      </p>

      <h2>#Two – The site’s credibility</h2>

      <p>
        Another important metric to put into consideration before choosing a
        website is its credibility. Is the website credible? Reliable? Consider
        navigating through the landing pages of the website to see its "About
        Us" section and see if it sends a strong message. Navigate through its
        mission as well as visions. Ensure also that the website looks updated
        and well put together.
      </p>

      <h2>#Three – The site’s traffic</h2>

      <p>
        There are several tools you can use to track the traffic that a website
        gets. A factor you should look out for is the monthly visit that the
        site gets. The higher this is, the greater the chances are for your blog
        to be viewed by more people and the more the referral traffic that would
        be generated.
      </p>

      <h2>#Four – The site’s affiliated blog</h2>

      <p>
        There should be a blog associated with any website that you’re going to
        write guest posts for and you need to be sure of this. If there are no
        associated blogs, then your content cannot be posted, and you would have
        wasted your time and energy writing guest posts for that website.
      </p>

      <h2>#Five – The site’s webpage design</h2>

      <p>
        There are several aspects of the website design you should look out for
        that are indicators of what the website can offer. Look out for the
        site's professional design, its unique custom-designed images, the ease
        of navigation, its mobile responsiveness, the number of pops and ads,
        and lastly, the number of low-quality external links associated with the
        website.
      </p>

      <h2>#Six – The site’s SEO metrics</h2>

      <p>
        You need to properly verify the SEO metrics of a site to see if it can
        contribute positively to your site's SEO. There are about 200 ranking
        factors to optimize on your site. You should look for sites with high
        domain authority, low spam score, high Moz rank, high trust flow, high
        citation flow, high organic ranking, and domain ranking.
      </p>

      <h2>#Seven – The site’s published contents</h2>

      <p>
        An important step to take before you pitch any article for guest
        blogging is to check previously published contents on the website. This
        is necessary for you to get an ideal feel for the kind of content that
        they post, the ideal word length, their writing style, article format,
        content quality, writing tone, and their use of unique images.
      </p>

      <h2>#Eight - The site’s social influence</h2>

      <p>
        If you want to know the quality of a site that you want to choose for
        your guest posting, then a very good criterion to check is its social
        media outreach. The metrics that you want to check include: the number
        of page following, its engagements on its social platforms, its active
        engagers, its frequency of posts, and its content niche.
      </p>

      <h2>#Nine – The site’s backlink’s issuing conditions</h2>

      <p>
        Something you may want to check is how strict the site is in giving
        backlinks. It is good to know all the conditions associated with the
        links you provide on the site. A good rule of thumb is to check if guest
        post links back to your site or are just author bio links. Check how
        long the sites will put up backlinks before taking them down.
      </p>

      <h2>#Ten - The domain history</h2>

      <p>
        You need to check if the website domain is expired. An expired domain is
        a domain that has not been renewed and it can be dangerous when used to
        sell links. To find out if a website has an expired domain, there are
        several tools that you can use to analyze its historical footprint. Try
        to avoid such websites.
      </p>

      <h2>#Eleven - Avoid PBNs – Private blog networks</h2>

      <p>
        Just like expired domains, using PBNs to generate backlinks can have
        dire consequences. PBNs are like link pyramids or networks. A network of
        blogs is created to keep exchanging backlinks. This has a way of
        manipulating the SEO ranking of the site. A penalty is being associated
        with such acts by Google, and so it is neither worth the time nor the
        energy.
      </p>

      <h2>#Twelve – The quality of their backlinks</h2>

      <p>
        There are several tools that you can use to check the quality of the
        backlinks for websites that you’re going to be pitching for. You need to
        check if they have high-quality as well as reputable links and even
        brand mentions from some big and reputable sites. Try to avoid sites
        that feature backlinks that are spammy as well as valueless.
      </p>

      <h2>#Thirteen - Articles Indexing Style</h2>

      <p>
        Before you write your articles for guest blogging, you should ensure
        that Google indexes the webpage in a timely fashion. Start by viewing
        the website's most recent article, and then google the title of the
        article together with the site search operator. This process should be
        repeated to understand how articles get indexed.
      </p>

      <h2>#Fourteen - Guesting post fee</h2>

      <p>
        Note that some opportunities may cost you in order to get your articles
        to the editor’s eyes. There may be fees associated with posting
        publications for some sites. Do make sure that the site in question has
        excellent authority and engagements accruing to it. In a situation
        whereby the site does not pass this check and still requests payment,
        you should pass on that opportunity.
      </p>

      <h2>#Fifteen - The ratio of outgoing-to-incoming domains</h2>

      <p>
        An important factor to check is the ratio of the outgoing to the
        incoming backlinks on the sites. The website receives inbound links from
        other sites like yours while outbound links are pages that the website
        links to. The number of inbound links is more important on the website
        because SEO values diversity.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is important for you as a blogger, hoping to get blog posting
        opportunities to carefully apply the entire matrix as listed. This would
        save a whole lot of time and energy and would give you the required SEO
        ranking as well as engagement on your site. It pays to take time to
        select which website that you should send your pitch to.
      </p>

      <p>
        So the next time you send that pitch, make sure you’ve done your
        assignment and can choose the best website to link your content.
