          While some people will assure you that they’ve never had to deal with
          procrastination as they love to get their things done in time, a lot
          of people like you and me struggle with procrastination.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you think about the tasks you have to complete, your brain
          unconsciously weighs it’s gravity and over exaggerates the outcome to
          your feeble mind. To get rid of the overwhelming feeling, your brain
          offers you a lighter solution- social media, and then overestimates
          how good that momentary pleasure would make you feel. After that you
          realize that your work is still undone and run into a panicked frenzy.
          <br />
          <br />
          In fact, you end up in a down spiraling cycle of anxiety, temporal
          relief and unproductivity. Definitely not a pleasant experience.

        <p>
          The good thing is you never have to go through that ever again.
          <br /><br />
          If you struggle with procrastination, I have compiled a list of 7 Tips
          to help you stop procrastinating on social media.
        </p>
        <img src="../imgs/working.png" alt="" />
        <h3>#Tip 1 – Put the device down!</h3>
        <p>
          -and before you come for me, yes. I know it’s a digital world and the
          work you have to do is literally on your phone or your computer,
          however you can still put your phone down in the literal sense.
          Ideally, I recommend having a different device for work related
          activities and a different one for extracurricular activities. But
          since everyone may not have the luxury, you can do simple but
          effective things like turning off all social media notifications, and
          blocking off unimportant calls for the duration of the task to be
          completed.
        </p>

        <br /><br /><br /><br />

        <h3>#Tip 2 – Change your environment</h3>
        <img src="../imgs/working.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          I bet you didn’t think of this one but this would literally work
          wonders for you. Your brain is wired in such a way that it associates
          location with activities. If you spend most of your time on social
          media when you’re lying down on your bed in your room, then chances
          are that the next time you’re in your room, your mind would
          subconsciously crave to achieve a similar effect. So don’t be
          surprised if you’re trying to do your work project and you suddenly
          find yourself scrolling away through your social media.
          <br /><br />
          Have a study room or a library that is only meant for work and this
          way, the only thing your brain can associate with when you’re in this
          room is work.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br />

        <h3>#Tip 3 – Outline your plans</h3>
        <p>
          Do you know that complications and procrastination are best friends?
          Those two walk hand in hand. You’re more likely to eagerly complete a
          simple task than a difficult one. When the brain feels like a task
          would be too stressful and demanding on it, it shuts downs. Sneaky
          little thing!
        </p>
        <img src="../imgs/working.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The best way to approach this is to break down the tasks you have to
          do into little parts. Asides making the brain now willing to analyze
          your task, it makes your work simpler! Next time you have an important
          work, remember that half of it’s progress lies in trying to break down
          the work into an outline. You can make up to 6 or 7 milestone just as
          long as they are able to capture every major tasks.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br />

        <h3>#Tip 4 – Create Timelines</h3>
        <img src="../imgs/working.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Don’t just stop at making outlines for your plans. Add timelines to
          them as well. Do you know the effect this has? It makes you
          accountable for your plans. When you’ve set out to accomplish a list
          of things within different time frame, you’ll be more eager to
          complete each task in time as you would not want to encroach into
          another task’s timeline.
          <br /><br />
          When I have chores or projects to do, I ensure to create a list of how
          I would like to complete the tasks and then assign timelines to them.
          The best thing about this is that you can do it all on your terms, so
          long as you get your task completed and in time.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br />

        <h3>#Tip 5 – Take breaks</h3>
        <p>
          If you try to overexert yourself, your body will shutdown and will
          make sure you do not succeed in your quest to adequately complete your
          tasks.
        </p>
        <img src="../imgs/working.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Be sure to include minor breaks in between tasks when creating your
          outline. This will make your plan less discouraging and much more
          easier to follow. This is also a way of applauding yourself for
          completing major milestones in your assignments or projects.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br />

        <h3>#Tip 6 – Share your plans</h3>
        <p>
          Unless you plan on doing something wrong, then maybe don’t share it;
          however, If you want to get something done quickly then just share it
          and you’ll never hear the end of it. If you share your plans with
          people in the same space as you like your family and friends, then
          chances are that they will keep checking in with you to see if you
          were finally able to complete what you talked to them about.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br />

        <h3>#Tip 7- Take advantage of the power of now</h3>
        <p>
          Lastly, if you’re already at that point where you feel miserable for
          not doing your work, and you have little time left, then just do this.
        </p>
        <img src="../imgs/working.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Start now. You need to take advantage of the power of now. This simply
          means that, right now, you should stop reading this article and drop
          your phone. You need to weigh the gravity of your work, the time you
          have left and with all the tips we have listed above, plan towards
          making productive use of the remaining time. You’d most likely achieve
          a far better result than you would have regretting your decisions.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <br />
          I’m really glad that we had this talk. If you follow this tips then
          you can be rest assured that you will never have to worry about
          trading your project or assignments for social media ever again.
