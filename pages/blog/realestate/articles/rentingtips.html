      <h2>Renting Tips for Renters</h2>
      <p><small>Date: November 1, 2023 | Author: Julia Mbamarah</small></p>

      <p>
        Lots of young adults will make their first move into a rented home or
        apartment this year. Thousands more are forced to rent apartments
        because they cannot afford to buy a home, even in their 30s and 40s.
        There can be lots of disagreements arising from renting properties. How
        much can property owners, tenants, and management companies work
        together to reduce this tension?
      </p>

      <p>Here are a few helpful tips:</p>

      <h2>Understand Every Detail</h2>

      <p>
        Before signing any agreement, make sure you completely understand its
        nature. Joint tenants occur when all the people who share rental
        property sign one agreement. Each renter in a joint tenancy agreement
        has the same legal rights as they are jointly and equally accountable
        for all rent and other responsibilities under the agreement. If you each
        sign a different lease, it will be viewed as if you have separate
        tenancies. Read the contract carefully and ask questions if you don't
        understand anything, such as the type of rent you'll be paying and
        whether it includes utilities or the duration of notice you'll need to
        give before moving out.
      </p>

      <h2>Seek assistance from parents or guardians</h2>

      <p>
        In the case of a rent payment delay or the need for repairs, the
        landlord may require a guarantor mostly a parent or a guardian. When
        many tenants live in a single rental property under a single lease, all
        guarantors are liable for any unpaid rent or damage caused by any of the
        tenants. Real estate specialist David Lawrenson discussed on his website
        LettingFocus.com that many children's parents may be unaware of this.
        This implies that they may be willing to foot the fees for their wards,
        but not so much for their ward buddies. One tip for Parents or Guardians
        is to restrict their obligation by stating it clearly in their guarantor
        agreement.
      </p>

      <h2>Check the inventory for confirmation</h2>

      <p>
        The property inventory may include furniture, sofas, carpets, curtains,
        appliances, china, and silverware. It is also a good practice to
        document any degradation or wear in the inventory, such as a curtain
        stain. If you are not provided with an inventory, you should always
        request one. If you cannot get one, create a comprehensive inventory
        list, have it signed by a witness and present a copy to your landlord.
      </p>

      <h2>Consider utility costs</h2>

      <p>
        Other expenses, such as utilities, cable, and internet, must be
        considered in addition to rent. It is crucial to know that some
        communities exclude students from paying taxes. Always double-check the
        amounts mentioned on your utility invoices to avoid being overcharged.
      </p>

      <h2>Safety first</h2>

      <p>
        If you wish to rent a large property to share with numerous tenants, you
        should enquire about whether the landlord has a valid license to
        accommodate that. If there are five or more unrelated persons living in
        the building and it has more than three floors, the landlord must
        register the property with the local authorities. A Gas Safe engineer
        should have inspected all gas appliances. Tenants have the right to seek
        an examination of the landlord's gas appliances once a year. In the
        absence of one, the landlord should also install a smoke alarm and a
        carbon monoxide detector. Many countries allow parents to cover their
        children's properties under their insurance. If you require insurance
        but are not covered under your parents' plan, it is in your best
        interest to look around.
      </p>

      <h2>Roommate disagreements</h2>

      <p>
        If you and your roommate have clear expectations from the outset, you
        may prevent many difficulties that may develop throughout your tenancy.
        Talk to your housemates about how you feel about the shared space. You
        may construct your own roommate agreement once you and your potential
        housemates have discussed and agreed on how to handle matters such as
        rent, utility payments, and housekeeping. If a big issue emerges and you
        and your roommates cannot agree on how to proceed, you may seek counsel
        from a local landlord-tenant attorney.
      </p>

      <h2>Have good accounting records</h2>

      <p>
        If there is a disagreement after you depart, this information may be
        valuable. In the case of a disagreement, having documentation such as
        dated and labeled images taken upon move-in, furniture receipts,
        notification of necessary repairs, and copies of invoices may be useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        The policy must be evaluated and double-checked regularly. If you take
        the time to do an inventory of your possessions, you will not only be
        able to keep track of what you own, but you will also be able to
        guarantee that your insurance coverage will give appropriate financial
        protection in the case of a severe loss. You will not just be in a
        better position to keep track of what you own if you take the time to
        establish an inventory of your stuff. If you have any questions about
        the coverage provided by your insurance policy, you should speak with
        your broker as soon as possible.
