      <h2>The Ultimate Guide to Time Boxing for Busy People</h2>

      <h1>The Ultimate Guide to Time Boxing for Busy People</h1>

      <p>
        With such little time left after the daily hustling and bustling of a
        day, work may sometimes seem overwhelming. Most people cannot remember
        when last they had free time or thought about something that wasn’t
        work-related.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you can relate to this, then you might have fallen into the trap that
        Parkinson described.
      </p>

        alt="Parkinson's Trap"
      />

      <p>
        According to him, “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its
        completion”. This means that even if you have little work to do and have
        say five days to complete it, it may take you the entire 5 days to
        complete the work. If, on the other hand, you have just 4 hours to
        complete that same work, you would eventually succeed in completing the
        job under just four hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most people are stuck in the first reality, and they don’t seem to
        understand why. It’s one thing to be busy, and it’s another entirely to
        be ‘busy wasting time’. This is also the reason why someone with a low
        productivity level may seem busier than someone with a high productivity
        level.
      </p>

      <p>
        But why is this so and how what can you do about it? Well, let’s talk
        about Time boxing.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Time boxing</h2>

      <p>
        Time boxing is where you’ll get to realize that you’ve probably been
        spending a lot more time than is necessary to complete different tasks.
        As the saying goes, you cannot evaluate what you cannot measure. If you
        do not intentionally plan and allocate time to the different tasks you
        do, then you cannot properly evaluate your productivity.
      </p>

      <img

        alt="Time Boxing"
      />

      <p>
        Time boxing is a form of time management where you allocate a fixed
        maximum amount of time for an activity or a task and then proceed to
        complete that activity within the set time frame. It typically follows
        an Allocate-Work-Stop-Access-Repeat pattern.
      </p>

      <p>
        You allocate a fixed and reasonable period of time for an activity, you
        work on that activity within the time block, once the time is up, you
        stop, then you review your tasks and assess whether you have reached
        your time goal. You can always repeat this process and record your
        progress. This is how you measure your productivity.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several steps to follow if you want to adequately master this
        art of time boxing. This will save you a lot of time whilst giving you
        the ability to track your progress and realize your actual time span for
        different tasks.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Adequately Timebox</h2>

      <h3>Step 1 – List out activities to be completed</h3>

      <p>
        To adequately allocate time to each of your activities, you need to list
        them out so you can see a visual representation of all the activities
        that you need to complete. This can help you categorize your tasks into
        short or long tasks, urgent or pending tasks, demanding or simple tasks.
      </p>

        alt="List of Activities"
      />

      <p>
        The ability to categorize your tasks will help you to understand how
        these tasks differ and the different time blocks that you should assign
        to each of them. Start with listing out the difficult tasks first, and
        then proceed to list out the ones that can be done within a few minutes.
        Remember not to leave out a single activity.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2 – Define your goals</h3>

      <p>
        You need to clearly define the goals that are associated with each and
        every one of your tasks. Your goal may be result-oriented. For example,
        if you were assigned to create a PowerPoint for a group presentation,
        then your goal may be something in the line of- “I want to have a
        visually appealing presentation with 10 slides that have been edited
        with Microsoft PowerPoint. And if your goal is time-bound, then it may
        be something in the line of “I want to have a visually appealing
        presentation with 10 slides that have been edited with Microsoft
        PowerPoint by the end of the day.”
      </p>

        src="https://images.app.goo.gl/82R4u7pQ63EVRELx5"
        alt="Define Your Goals"
      />

      <p>
        Properly defining your goals and not leaving any detail behind will
        enable you to effectively plan your activities without leaving any stone
        unturned.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 3 – Set the time</h3>

      <img
        src="https://images.app.goo.gl/Eu1wRCDA6bNKVFuRA"
        alt="Set the Time"
      />

      <p>
        This is where time management comes in. You can draw up a table manually
        or with a computer, or you can decide to use a time management app. You
        basically want something that can show you the different days of the
        week in a complete 24-hours time frame.
      </p>

      <p>
        After you have clearly defined your goals, it’s time to start allocating
        time to them, that is, the number of hours you’re willing to work on
        them daily and the total amount of time it would take you to
        successfully complete a project. This process is called time boxing, and
        it allows you to allot a fixed, maximum unit of time for activities and
        then complete them within that time frame.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4 – Work and Review</h3>

      <p>
        The next step is to do the actual work while adhering to all the time
        frames that you have set for yourself. You want to stick to the plan so
        that you can accurately capture your progress. Start with your first
        scheduled task and follow it exactly as you have planned it. It's just
        as the saying goes, ‘Half of the work is in the planning'. This way, you
        juggle so many tasks at once or worry about the next activity to do.
      </p>
      <br /><br /><br />
      <p>
        I hope this guide has been helpful. If you find yourself drowning in all
        your activities, then timeboxing might just be the approach that you’ve
        been looking for. You can adopt it in your daily routine and use it to
        track your activities, measure your productivity, and realize more time
        for yourself and your schedule.
