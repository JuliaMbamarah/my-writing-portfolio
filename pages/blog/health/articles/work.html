      <p>
        Working from home was not so popularly practiced by us until the
        COVID-19 pandemic hit the globe. This era affected virtually everything
        that you and I did ranging from tourism, work, traveling, sports,
        religious activities, meetings and conferences to mention but a few.
        Industries, companies, and institutions from all spheres of life had no
        option but to work remotely. You are well aware that working from home
        has now become the order of the day as well as the new future of work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working remotely comes with so many benefits, from having a comfortable,
        flexible schedule and a lot more. However, working from home can be
        quite tricky and dangerous if not properly managed. Procrastination and
        distractions are some of the ills that accompany working remotely. You
        will need to put in extra effort to be more productive while working
        from home. Here are five ways to become more productive when working
        from home.
      </p>

      <h2>#Tip 1 - CREATE AN OFFICE OR WORKSPACE AT HOME</h2>
      <img
        src="https://images.app.goo.gl/H7W97ik8F35a5L2e6"
        alt="Workspace Image"
      />
      <p>
        Providing a working area at home is a very crucial step in achieving
        productivity while working from home. Select a space within your home,
        put a good working desk, chair, computer with a good internet connection
        that will be comfortable to work with; however, it mustn’t be so
        comfortable so as to distract you or make you slack during work. This is
        actually the spot where you do all your work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep your workspace neat and tidy with great natural or artificial
        lighting that is appealing to the eyes. Endeavor to stuff your workspace
        with the necessary working materials to enhance focus and productivity
        while working remotely. A gentle reminder, using your bed or couch as
        your workspace will only hamper your productivity.
      </p>

      <h2>#Tip 2 - PREPARE A TO-DO LIST</h2>
      <img
        src="https://images.app.goo.gl/fR6KQyui8hToLrDM8"
        alt="To-Do List Image"
      />
      <p>
        Having a to-do list helps you to checkmate yourself on the things you
        need to accomplish and also enables visualizing and monitoring your
        progress. Personally, I have found this very helpful because whenever I
        start to digress from what I have set out to do, my to-do list will
        always put me back on track. Make your to-do list time-bound. Endeavor
        to strike out each project and work once they are accomplished. This
        will invariably help in monitoring your work progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of each working day, outline the next day’s to-do list to
        mentally prepare you for the next task or project ahead. If you fail to
        plan, you plan to fail.
      </p>

      <h2>#Tip 3 - AVOID PROCRASTINATION</h2>
      <img
        src="https://images.app.goo.gl/dwnR57x7abRD6jgt6"
        alt="Procrastination Image"
      />
      <p>
        I bet we all fall prey to this kanker worm that eats up our working time
        which leads to low productivity. To be on the safe side, always try to
        accomplish every task in your to-do list at the exact time allocated for
        it. Never leave any stone unturned.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know you may be thinking, “What if I do 85% of my designated work and
        then complete the rest tomorrow?” No is definitely my honest answer. You
        will develop the habit of constantly pushing things off to another day
        which is definitely difficult to get out of.
      </p>

      <p>
        Procrastination can really put you back further during days of
        emergency. This will interrupt your work and finally lead to low
        productivity which is quite different from the set goal. Working from
        home requires great discipline to ensure great productivity.
      </p>

      <h2>#Tip 4 - CONSTANT COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTION</h2>
      <img
        src="https://images.app.goo.gl/bkYNP4gAWsjYuHVT9"
        alt="Communication Image"
      />
      <p>
        Communication is very paramount and important if you are to attain great
        productivity when working from home. Communicating with your supervisor,
        boss, team, or client regularly goes a long way to reflect positively on
        your work ethics. Always keep your boss, supervisor, or client updated
        on what you are working on and reach out to your team when a need for
        help and assistance arises.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are confused about the project you are handling and you need
        clarification, communication with the appropriate channel will certainly
        do justice to it. Endeavor to have a total understanding of the task or
        project you are working on and try to communicate any form of
        misconception to the right people be it your supervisor, your boss, your
        team, or your client. This will facilitate the desired productivity
        while working from home.
      </p>

      <h2>#Tip 5 - HAVE INTERMITTENT BREAKS</h2>
      <img
        src="https://images.app.goo.gl/TuuSrLHzWJ43V7kx7"
        alt="Breaks Image"
      />
      <p>
        As the saying goes “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” The
        play in this context is having intermittent breaks when working from
        home. Although you will be working ceaselessly hard, following your
        schedule and making sure you accomplish your set goals for the day, take
        some time off to really take care of yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s very necessary to take a few brief breaks throughout the day and
        have a power nap, you could take a snack break, talk to a loved one,
        meditate, take a stroll, walk your dog and have so many other relaxation
        activities. It is quite tricky to feel like you could be online and
        available at all hours of the workday. As long as you are not away from
        your workspace for more than 20 minutes, it is appropriate and advisable
        to have intermittent breaks when working remotely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working remotely is very different from working from the office. Working
        from home certainly requires discipline. Always be intentional in order
        to be productive. You will find working from home a lot easier if you
        follow the tips. The key is to keep the best work balance, instill
        discipline, establish boundaries and finally take very good care of
        yourself.
