      <h2>What is Self-Confidence?</h2>
      <p><small>Date: November 1, 2023 | Author: Julia Mbamarah</small></p>

      <p>
        When you walk into an exam hall confident, you're going to ace the test,
        you have self-confidence. A person is confident when they believe they
        can do a task successfully by using their judgment, knowledge, and past
        experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Self-confidence is an attitude about your skills and abilities. It
        implies that you accept and trust yourself, and that you have a sense of
        control over your life. You are aware of your own talents and weaknesses
        and have a good self-image. You have the ability to set realistic
        objectives and goals, speak assertively, and take criticism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Low self-confidence, on the other hand, may cause you to question
        yourself, be weak or subservient, or have difficulties trusting others.
        You may feel inferior, neglected, or easily offended. Feeling confidence
        in oneself could depend on the scenario. For instance, you can feel very
        confident in some areas, such as academics, but lack confidence in
        others, like relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
        Self-confidence is rarely related to actual abilities and is mostly
        based on your perceptions. Perceptions are the way you think about
        yourself and these thoughts can be flawed. Growing up in an unsupportive
        and critical atmosphere, being away from friends or family for the first
        time, evaluating oneself too harshly, or being terrified of failure can
        all lead to low self-confidence. People who lack self-confidence
        frequently make mistakes in their reasoning.
      </p>

      <h2>Where does self-confidence come from?</h2>

      <p>Two types of confidence exist:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Intrinsic Confidence</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Extrinsic Confidence</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <h3>1. Intrinsic Confidence</h3>

      <p>
        Intrinsic confidence is equivalent to self-assurance. It means that your
        confidence comes from within and that you are not reliant on others to
        give it to you. Confidence originates from inside and is fueled by your
        accomplishments and pleasure. Contrary to common assumption,
        self-assurance is not necessarily innate. According to one poll, just
        one in ten respondents believe their self-confidence is inherent. Others
        believe that their self-assurance is derived from other sources. This
        demonstrates how difficult it is to create genuine inherent confidence.
        Few people have the mental fortitude to do so, and those who do must
        train for years. When a person can embrace their accomplishments and
        look up to themselves as someone who should be admired, they are on the
        road to developing intrinsic self-confidence.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Extrinsic Confidence</h3>

      <p>
        Extrinsic confidence is when you rely on others to give you confidence.
        People around you make you think that you are deserving of what you have
        accomplished and motivate you to do even more. Extrinsic self-esteem is
        self-esteem that comes from somewhere other than oneself. In other
        words, it is the kind of self-esteem that comes from outside sources
        such as other people, praises, accomplishments, or acclaim. When you
        need short-term motivation, external confidence comes in handy. You can
        always rely on people to encourage you for a limited time. It is
        considerably easier and requires less effort to create inner confidence.
        While there is nothing wrong with relying on others, extrinsic
        confidence is not always sufficient. If people don't believe in us, no
        matter how much we want to, we begin to doubt ourselves. It is never
        good to rely solely on people for anything, let alone your source of
        happiness. It will always be difficult to locate people on whom you can
        rely for consistent inspiration.
