      <h2>The Power of Crypto: Exploring Future Prospects</h2>
      <p><small>Date: November 1, 2023 | Author: Julia Mbamarah</small></p>

      <p>
        If you’re alive in this modern word, then chances are that you must have
        come across the term ‘crypto’. You must have heard it from a friend,
        your son or daughter, the news and the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chances are that you’re either a crazy investor who hodls his coins in
        hopes that they would one day yield massive return or a crypto trader
        who takes advantage of the volatility of the crypto market.
      </p>

      <p>
        If neither, then maybe you’re one of those people observing the market
        from the fence, confused about what is going on and wondering how Steve
        was able to afford a Rolex within few months after he told you that he
        was into Crypto trading.
      </p>

      <p>I mean, you invest too!</p>

      <p>
        You have shares, bonds and whatnots in various companies, so what kind
        of crazy turnaround is Steve getting his hands into that you just can’t
        seem to understand?
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, whichever category describes you, whether ‘Crazy investor' or
        'Stephen’s admirer' this article is for you as we will be exploring the
        power of crypto, and its future prospects - everything you’ve always
        wanted to know, all in one place.

      <h3>Bitcoin vs. Ethereum 5</h3>

      <p>
        There are so many coins in the market today. However, do you know what
        is interesting about these two coins? They are the two most popular and
        highest valued crypto by market cap at the moment.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          While Bitcoin was made decentralized in the year 2009, Ethereum became
          digitalized in the year 2015.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bitcoins market cap is over $10billion while that of Ethereum is under
          $1billion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Other coins</p>
      <figure>
        <img

          alt="Other Coins"
        />
        <figcaption>Other Coins</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Not everyone would tell you this but coins have division in Crypto
        terms. We have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin</li>
        <li>Shitcoins</li>
        <li>Altcoins</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Since Bitcoin is the first crypto and the coin with the highest value,
        it has a whole category dedicated to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shit coins as the name suggests are coins that are shitty in nature.
        They have no value and no potential to increase as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Altcoins was coined from the word ‘alternative’. It refers to all other
        coins such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Dodgecoin, Tron, etc.
      </p>

      <h3>Are Bitcoin and Ethereum the new gold and silver?</h3>

      <p>
        When you see pictorial representations of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the
        symbol of Bitcoin is usually encrypted in a gold coin. That of Ethereum
        is encrypted in a silver coin.
      </p>

      <p>
        This has caused a lot of uproar and people want to know, “Are bitcoin
        and Ethereum the new gold and silver?”
      </p>

      <p>Well, technologically speaking, the answer is yes!</p>

      <h2>Reasons Why Crypto Holds Power</h2>

      <h3>Reason 1 – It cannot be counterfeited</h3>

      <p>
        Unlike credit cards, Crypto cannot be reversed back to the sender
        neither can it be counterfeited. The technology lies in cryptography and
        this allows you to sign the operations that are carried out all the
        interconnected network. This prevents all fraudulent operations.
      </p>

      <h3>Reason 2 – It is recognized on a universal level</h3>

      <p>
        Crypto can be used at international levels as it is now being widely
        recognized even for international payment. It is not bound by exchange
        rates, interest rates, transaction charges, or specific country charges.
        The payment structure is such that the crypto coins are held in wallets
        while the payment transactions are collected in blocks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like John Mcafee, Founder of Mcafee said, "You can't stop things
        like Bitcoin. It will be everywhere and the world will have to readjust.
        World governments will have to readjust".
      </p>

          alt="Identity Theft"
        />
        <figcaption>Identity Theft</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Reason 3 – There is no risk of identity theft</h3>

      <p>
        Blockchain, the technology upon which crypto lies, prevents identity
        theft in 3 ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It lets you own your data by keeping your online information secure.
          It automatically signals you in the event of any fraudulent attempt.
        </li>
        <li>
          It enhances its fraud entry barrier. It eliminates the need for a
          centralized authority and strengthens its network security to a point
          where it is impenetrable.
        </li>
        <li>
          It secures transactions you make online through cards. It would not
          allow any transaction you make online to be successful unless it is
          verified as legitimate.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reason 4- Ituses a decentralized technology</h3>

      <p>
        In this way, no single person or group has control; rather, it is
        collectively controlled by all users. A global network of computers
        jointly manages the database. With the use of decentralized technology,
        the database records transactions on a user-to-user basis.
      </p>

      <h3>Reason 5 – It has Lower fees</h3>

      <p>
        Another good thing about crypto is that there are usually no transaction
        fees for crypto exchanges. This is because the miners are already
        compensated by the network. Isn't that just great?
      </p>

      <h3>Reason 6 – There is access to the market for everyone</h3>

      <p>
        The best news is that everyone can access this digital market. With
        billions of people all over the world, crypto serves as a better means
        to access exchanges and perform all transactions. It is safe, secured
        and is not bound by country charges.
      </p>

      <h2>Why you should invest in crypto</h2>

      <h3>Big companies that are embracing Bitcoin</h3>

      <p>
        Most corporations are securing their company and their asset with
        blockchain. A lot of big brands have already started accepting bitcoin
        as a source of payment. There are now bitcoin ATM machines as well as
        virtual cards to make it more accessible for its holders. A few of these
        big brands include: Microsoft, Amazon, Dell, Target, Wordpress, Tesla,
        Target, Overstock, and a lot more.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re wondering, Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google made this comment:
        "Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement and the ability to
        create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has
        enormous value."
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h3>Banks and government are embracing crypto</h3>

      <p>
        The Bank of America has already made several statements to indicate that
        they are investing in blockchain and crypto. The Bank of England since
        2016 launched a blockchain accelerator. Traditional banking systems and
        investment institutions are quickly realizing its potential and are now
        beginning to adopt it.
      </p>

      <h3>Number of Blockchain wallets are increasing</h3>

      <p>
        From 2015 till now, the number of bitcoin wallet holders has increased
        from just 3.16 million to almost 70 million users. How mind-blowing! The
        interest in decentralized digital technology is undeniably increasing.
        The fact that there are diverse wallets to choose from makes it all the
        more interesting.
      </p>

      <h3>Incredible returns.</h3>

      <p>
        Let's get one thing straight. Whether you’re investing for the long term
        or you’re trading cryptocurrency, the returns are huge. Yes, the market
        may be volatile but these large returns come from taking advantage of
        the market's volatility. Trading would yield short term but reasonable
        returns and it is continuous. Long-term trade may yield massive returns
        for potential investors.
      </p>

      <h3>Crypto predictions by experts will blow your mind</h3>

      <p>
        Before the coronavirus hit the globe, experts had predicted a fall then
        a boom in the rise of cryptocurrencies. The boom did not come with just
        an increase in value but an increase in interested investors as well as
        individuals. Brock Pierce, former mighty ducks star said, ‘After seeing
        the growth of bitcoin in the last six months, I am very optimistic about
        this technology.’ Experts have predicted that crypto will not fall but
        continue to rise as more and more businesses, banks, individuals, and
        countries adopt it.
      </p>

      <h2>Crypto IRA</h2>

      <p>
        We already talked extensively about IRAs in our previous articles on
        gold. Just like we have Precious metal IRAs, a Crypto IRA is a
        self-directed IRA that can hold any cryptocurrency ranging from Bitcoin,
        Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and every other coin.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="https://images.app.goo.gl/Vsc5VgLCNQT9ctMz6"
          alt="Crypto IRA"
        />
        <figcaption>Crypto IRA</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Experts would always advise you to have a portfolio that is diversified.
        Converting part of your retirement savings to Bitcoin or Ethereum can
        reduce your portfolio volatility as well as yield potential large
        returns in the future.
      </p>

      <h3>Transfer or Rollover</h3>

      <p>
        Like we discussed in the previous article, there are two ways to fund
        your Crypto IRA. The first alternative is always to opt for a transfer
        from your current IRA account. Here, the asset flows from custodian to
        another, and the great thing about this is that you can do it as many
        times as you want.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your second alternative is a rollover like that of a 401k to crypto IRA
        rollover. Here, a rollover is only possible after you must have received
        a distribution from your already existing IRA. Then you deposit the
        funds into a new IRA custodian account, and this is only possible within
        60 days, after which you would incur taxes and penalties on your
        withdrawal. Unlike the transfer option, you may only roll over your
        funds once in 12 months.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        The best financial step you can take for yourself and your portfolio is
        to invest in Cryptocurrency. Its market is volatile and
