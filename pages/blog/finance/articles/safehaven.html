      <h2>A Safe Haven: The Power of Gold Bullion in Times of Crises</h2>
      <p><small>Date: November 1, 2023 | Author: Julia Mbamarah</small></p>

      <p>
        I see many people across the internet ask many questions about gold. The
        power of gold is certainly real, and I will be explaining why it is a
        safe haven in times of crisis.
      </p>

      <p>
        But first, I want you to imagine there is a global crisis happening
        right now. And if you can’t do that, just think back to the first time
        you heard about covid-19, maybe on the news, maybe from a friend or on
        social media.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now think about how the economy dwindled sharply after that without
        proper forecast and future analysis for the stock market.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        With no warning and predictive analysis about the outcome to follow a
        global and devastating crisis like the one experienced not too long ago,
        most people thought about two things:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Am I safe?</li>
        <li>Are my life savings and investments secured?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Sadly, most of you saw your ‘trusted’ means of investments dwindle with
        the economy as the value of your currencies hit all-time lows.
      </p>

      <p>
        But what if I tell you that while your investments were playing games
        with you in the heat of all the crises, some people were basking in the
        safe haven of a commodity they trusted - Gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        When big investors like George Soros said and I quote, “The U.S dollars
        is very weak. Investors are moving to other assets”, he definitely was
        not kidding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Experts will always advise against having portfolios that are controlled
        by the same factors in an economy. They always buttress the need to have
        a diversified portfolio.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the late 1970s and early 2000s, the financial market was favorable
        for gold but other stocks suffered greatly. Similarly, in the 1980s, the
        gold market saw a great loss while other stocks rose greatly.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the volatility of the factors that affect the performance of an
        investment or its ability to hold value, its independency is probably
        one of the greatest attributes to its unique performance especially in
        times of crises.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Why gold is considered as a safe haven for these persons and why it
        should be considered as such to you.
      </h2>

      <p>Is it worth to invest in gold?</p>

      <p>
        Well, let’s just put it in the words of Michael Avery who owns billions
        of investments in gold. He said, “In 5000 years of human history, gold
        has been the currency of choice, the store of value when humans have
        called into question their government’s effort to solve problems by
        running printing presses and injecting money into the economy.”
      </p>

      <p>
        For Michael Avery, gold Investment is not a new thing, something he
        ventured into over years when he had seen the prospect of the commodity.
      </p>

      <p>
        And because of billionaire investors like Michael, and other heavy
        individual and company investors who just like Michael realize the
        prospect of this commodity, gold is estimated to keep rising in value
        over years.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can already guess that the law of demand and supply plays a major
        role in determining the behavior of a commodity. In the case of gold,
        the more investment is pumped into it, the higher its value.
      </p>

      <p>
        While you’re also busy hoarding your dwindling and unstable currency,
        the banks that you trust with your money, the assets you invested in,
        and the government were stocking up heavily on gold to preserve its
        currency value.
      </p>

      <p>
        In just 10 years, the world official central bank holdings have
        increased from 28.5 Metric tons (which weighs about a 1000 times more in
        kilograms) to 33.5 Metric tons as of 2019. And now the amount of gold it
        possesses is a whooping**
      </p>

      <figure>

      </figure>

      <p>
        Let’s go back to the heat of any global crises, in the case of Covid-19.
        People want a place to safeguard their currency value and although there
        are a lot of options everywhere, the safest and the option that
        individuals, organizations, governments, and corporations end up taking
        is investing in gold bullion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The U.S.A alone hoards the highest amount of gold with countries like
        Germany, IMF, Italy, France, and China following right after. Russia,
        Switzerland, Japan, and the Netherlands follow right after and these
        countries make up the top 10 gold hoarders in the history of the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this time, because there is a bullish increase in the demand for gold
        in the midst of the crises,the price of gold rockets. So it not only
        preserves your currency value but if you’re smart enough to invest at
        the right time, it gives you a very large return as compared to your
        initial capital.
      </p>

      <h2>Why people buy gold in times of crises</h2>

      <p>
        Yet, some of you still want to know why people buy gold in times of
        crises?
      </p>

      <p>
        It is for reasons such as what we have just explored above, how the
        price of gold seems to preserve its value and even rise amidst crises
        and for some other reasons that we are going to right now explore.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fact that Gold is a real asset makes it a more than often a very
        desirable commodity to possess. Trust me during a crises, you want
        nothing more than to know that you have an asset that is tangible,
        probably sitting somewhere in a bullion bank or encrypted with a lot of
        security whilst preserving the value of your currency. What can be more
        assuring!
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.app.goo.gl/RmkD6onuP4KVPJMo6" alt="Fig5" />
        <figcaption>Fig 5</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The fact that you can decide to either buy physical gold or paper gold
        makes it more desirable and attainable.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Physical gold is a real long term investment asset and can be bought
          in bullions, however, it needs to be properly stored and that incurs a
          fee.
        </li>
        <li>
          Paper gold is an asset that reflects the price of the actual gold. It
          is a great option when you want to buy in smaller quantities and for a
          smaller value.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There is no limitation when it comes to buying gold. Of course, not
        everyone can afford to buy gold bullion at the current value it holds
        which is why paper gold is the best option for buying gold in smaller
        quantities and for smaller value. Whichever you decide to buy still
        preserves your interest.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        Like we already saw in the likes of billionaire investors like Michael
        Avery and George Soros, there is a rising demand amongst stockholders
        and new investors in gold. The potential of gold as a prospective
        commodity is being realized by more and more companies, organizations,
        individuals, and corporations. Jim Rodgers, a millionaire investor even
        said: “Gold will be the great investment over the next decade,” - And
        when Eike Batista, another billionaire investor, said “There is a
        massive shifting of wealth to new economic powers,” he was referring to
        the commodity- Gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Companies like Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway, Investors and
        shareholders like George Soros and John Paulson are abandoning the stock
        market. Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway released 96% percent of their
        Johnson and Johnson shares and about 97% of its Kraft Foods Group.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this wave of realization and the pumping of investments in gold,
        the value of gold is estimated to keep rising as more investors, banks
        and even the government hoard this commodity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also in the history of the asset, gold, it has experienced a constantly
        increasing purchasing power as compared to other currencies such as the
        US dollars. This is probably due to the fact that the US is in $23
        trillion worth of national debt and would only get worse over time. This
        is why Marc Stern who holds $550 million of Bessemer said, “At the core
        of the sharp downturn is an absence of confidence. Rising debt levels in
        Europe and the U.S., uncertainty about policymakers’ willingness to
        restore fiscal order, and increasingly cautious corporate sentiment that
        is consistent with slowing global growth are the chief culprits.”
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the purchasing power of gold is relatively stable over the long
        run but within a short period, may vary greatly.

      <h2>How much is too much?</h2>

      <p>
        It is one thing to want to invest in an asset such as gold and it’s
        another thing entirely when it comes to investing.
      </p>

      <p>Most people wind up with questions such as,</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>“How much percentage of my portfolio should I allocate to gold?”</p>
        <p>I had an investor once ask me directly,</p>
        <p>“Do I allocate all my resources to gold during a global crisis?”</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The answer I would give anyone in this context and the only answer that
        would probably set up the basis on which your future investments are
        going to lie is that before you can invest in a commodity such as gold,
        you must be well grounded in the risk associated with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are risk factors associated with any investments and you must be
        well versed with these to make such an important decision as to the
        percentage of your portfolio to invest in any commodity.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this vein, we’d be assessing the risk factors associated with
        investing in gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are five factors one must consider before investing in any
        commodity and they are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Income</li>
        <li>Speculation</li>
        <li>Growth</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Foundation</li>
      </ul>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.app.goo.gl/4yoHbJ45V62bLJRF8" alt="Fig7" />
        <figcaption>Fig 7</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Investments are risky but having a strong foundation is very essential
        because then, it can withstand market instability and other factors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gold bullions have a very solid foundation and that is one of the
        reasons why it is able to withstand deflation and a downward spiral of
        the economy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike most commodities, the security associated with gold is very high.
        Like we discussed earlier, gold can actually be bought in two ways,
        physical gold and paper gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because gold has no counterparty risk, it means that physical gold
        cannot be bankrupt and bullion gold cannot default on obligations.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to speculations and growth for this commodity, it is
        difficult to make futuristic analysis or properly analyze the growth
        trend of this commodity and so it is difficult to make predictions about
        its performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, it all comes down to you to make the final decision, keep in
        mind your need for a diversified portfolio. This means you are not going
        to invest all your assets in gold- obviously.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the words of M.G. George Muthoot, “If this business was as easy as it
        sounds, all my branch managers would be setting up their own gold loan
        companies.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Experts suggest that you invest 10 – 20% of your liquid assets and not
        your overall portfolio.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, you can weigh the risk together with the opportunities
        associated with this commodity and decide just how much of your
        portfolio you should invest in gold especially during the time of
        crises.
