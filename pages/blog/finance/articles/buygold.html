      <p>
        With the recent boom in digital currencies and the wide diversification
        of investment opportunities, most people just can’t help being confused
        about what to invest in. More opportunities for investments mean more
        skepticism and confusion towards which kind of investments to engage in.
        Well, that is totally normal because the more opportunities for
        investments are out there, the more work that is to be done to follow up
        the investment’s history, trends, new developments as well as their
        future implication.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same issue presents itself to people who want to invest in gold are
        unsure of where to start, whether investing in gold is a viable option
        or even what gold stock to buy. Gold was highly valued as far back as
        4000 BC for how attractive and lustrous it was. It was a symbolism for
        power, wealth, and beauty. Found in its natural state as a shiny metal,
        it was earlier used for decorative and ornamental purposes because of
        its physically attractive nature and was eventually given spiritual
        symbolism to Gods and great rulers. However, the ancients soon found out
        that those were just a fraction of what gold is used for and in the
        1500’s BC, gold became a medium of exchange for international trades.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gold has a dense yellow lustre, denoted by AU from the word Aurum and
        belongs to period 6 and group 11 of the periodic table. It is durable
        and highly malleable and can be obtained in nature in its pure form. The
        amount of gold in the world can be wrapped eleven times around the world
        if it was pulled into a five-micron thick wire.
      </p>

      <h2>Interesting History</h2>

      <p>
        The ‘Mint and Coinage Act’ that was passed by the US congress in 1792
        was probably one of the biggest factors that drove the gold investment
        market. However, Gold as an investment came into existence in 1970 when
        the US government yet again made legal the trading of physical Gold and
        reversed it after five years with the Gold Reverse Act of 1934. This
        occurred during the great depression where some countries like the US
        and the UK abandoned the gold standard.
      </p>

      <h2>Gold as a financial investment</h2>

      <p>
        It is without doubt that gold has been a very valued commodity for ages
        and an investment opportunity with proven track records and a lot of
        opportunities for the future. The key here lies in understanding the
        market, the economics that drives this commodity, when best to invest in
        gold and even what gold stock to buy.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, will gold price increase this 2021? This is the question that a lot
        of people have asked and are still asking and it is for this reason that
        we would explore 10 reasons why we must invest in gold this 2021:
      </p>

      <h2>1. Coverage against Deflation</h2>

      <p>
        The great Depression of the 1930’s is always a great example to cite
        because there was a global price decrease and slowness of business
        activities. At this time, because of the general insecurity about
        currencies dropping, people exchanged their money for gold. What this
        did was to protect the value and even skyrocketed it as the value of
        currencies dropped across borders. Deflation is a problem that is
        repeating and that is why to protect money value, gold is the best
        option to turn to. In recent light, the Covid-19 pandemic that hit the
        world in 2020 saw the global economy shutting down and most countries'
        currency value dropping with light’s speed. Now check out how the price
        of gold performed through it all.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Portfolio Multiplicity</h2>

      <p>
        Having a diversified investment is a great way of reducing volatility
        associated with investments. Diversified in this sense refers to
        investing in a commodity that is not correlated to other stocks and if
        any commodity possesses this quality, it is gold. This is proven through
        the historical records of gold especially in the late 1970’s and early
        2000’s where the market was favorable for gold but horrible for other
        stocks. Conversely, in the 1980’s, gold suffered while other stocks
        thrived. The independency of gold is probably one of the major reasons
        why you should invest in gold right now.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Pace of Gold Production</h2>

      <p>
        There has been a constraint to the global supply of gold from central
        banks since the 2000s and a decline in the rate of production from gold
        mines. Ordin Ordinarily, a reduction in the production of gold leads to
        a subsequent increase in price and affects how often gold price changes.
        This would keep increasing with the estimated decrease in the production
        of gold.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Intergovernmental Incertitude</h2>

      <p>
        In times of geopolitical uncertainty and economic instability, gold is a
        run-to haven because of its known ability to retain its value,
        especially during times of crisis. Countries experience geopolitical
        problems every now and then, and even if your country is not
        experiencing any instability, gold is still a great option for you to
        save your money because now, there are no uncertainties.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Inflation Barrier</h2>

      <p>
        Just as gold protects currencies from deflation, it acts as a hedge
        against inflation as the price increases when the cost of living
        increases. It is a good store of value, especially when people in a
        country perceive that their currency is losing value.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Value Holding History</h2>

      <p>
        Unlike any other commodity, gold has a strong history of maintaining and
        even increasing its value. It is even seen as a means of wealth transfer
        between generations as it doesn’t fade away or corrode.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Measurable Asset</h2>

      <p>
        It is a tangible asset in the sense that it gives a safety feeling as
        compared to purchasing an asset like real estate and also because unlike
        other digital assets, it cannot be hacked so security is assured.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Rising Demand amongst Investors</h2>

      <p>
        With demand rising amongst stockholders and new investors as the
        potential of gold as a financial investment is being recognized, the
        price of gold is increasing.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Dollar Strength</h2>

      <p>
        When the prices of the dollar fluctuate, people tend to flock to the
        security of gold and this, in turn, increases the price of gold.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Easily Accessible Rate of Liquidation</h2>

      <p>
        It has a fast rate of liquidation as compared to other commodities; It
        has no lock-in period and can easily be redeemed.
      </p>
