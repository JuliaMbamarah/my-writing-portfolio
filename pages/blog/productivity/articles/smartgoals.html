      <h2>How to Set SMART Goals: The Ultimate Guide</h2>

      <p>
        Permit me to say that everyone has goals. Not a lot of people set these
        goals. If you’ve successfully been able to turn an idea or a task into a
        goal then congratulations! However, you should know that a goal cannot
        be sustainable if it has not been properly defined. Mind you, the word
        is ‘properly defined’.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you still have the same wavering goal that you’ve had for years; say,
        you made a decision to brush twice a day and till now you’ve made
        minimal progress because you have continued to relapse, then you most
        certainly do not have a defined goal.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re not setting SMART goals, then you might as well stop setting
        goals altogether because those will get you nowhere. I like to define
        SMART goals as everything you need to realize your goal’s potential.

      </p>

      <p>SMART goals are goals that are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Specific</li>
        <li>Measurable</li>
        <li>Attainable</li>
        <li>Relevant</li>
        <li>Time-based</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I’ll be explaining how exactly to set these types of goals.</p>

      <h2>One – Specific goals</h2>

      <p>
        You need to start now to define specific goals. Hit the nail on the head
        and leave no information behind. This is probably the most important
        part of setting your goals and the part that most people neglect. Start
        with clearly stating out the information surrounding the goal you’re
        trying to achieve.
      </p>

        alt="Specific Goals"
      />

      <p>
        Say you’re looking towards starting your own Tech start-up, then a
        specific goal may be something in the lines of ‘I want to gain the
        necessary economic, business, financial and marketing knowledge and
        experience I would require to run a successful company.’ Another example
        could be in the lines of, ‘I want to learn how to code in python so I
        can employ it in learning ‘Machine learning’.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trick is in clearly capturing what you need to achieve what you
        want.
      </p>

      <h2>Two – Measurable goals</h2>

      <p>
        How many times have you heard the saying that you cannot evaluate what
        you cannot measure? The reality cannot be far from the truth. This is
        where most people mess up their plans. Measuring your goals is the only
        way to checkmate yourself and access your progress.
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://images.app.goo.gl/LV2M6szSLk8MswgB9"
        alt="Measurable Goals"
      />

      <p>
        For example, in your quest to start your own Tech company, after you
        must have clearly specified your goal, you need to have certain
        conditions set in place to enable you to actively measure your progress.
        Another example could be in the lines of, ‘I will practice what I’ve
        learnt at the end of each day’s work to see if I’m making progress’.
      </p>

      <h2>Three – Achievable goals</h2>

      <p>
        Don’t fall into the trap of unrealistic goal setting. If there is no
        how, then can be no activity. You know a goal is unrealistic when there
        is no reasonable possible means of achieving it. This may be due to
        limitations in resources, skill, time or energy.
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://images.app.goo.gl/m6Jmk4VgFwNriVss9"
        alt="Achievable Goals"
      />

      <p>
        In your quest, let no one stop you from aiming for the stars and
        stretching beyond what you feel is your limit; however know that if you
        set goals that are way beyond your reach in terms of any of those
        factors we discussed above or more, then you’re probably going to end up
        with frustrated goals.
      </p>

      <h2>Four – Relevant goals</h2>

      <p>
        This is the aspect that should matter most to you. You must determine
        how the goal you’re trying to achieve matters to your broader
        perspectives. Most of our goals are short term, at least after we must
        have broken the long-term goal into achievable milestones.
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://images.app.goo.gl/PDxgCbwzYagHt9S1A"
        alt="Relevant Goals"
      />

      <p>
        If a present goal doesn’t seem worthwhile, then you most likely defined
        the wrong goal. They should align with your bigger picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, for our Tech Start-up, a goal such as ‘expanding services
        and products’ may not be as worthwhile for it in its seed stage. Few
        years into its growth, then that would be a fantastic target relevant to
        starting a successful Tech Start-up. Also, in your Python learning
        journey for Machine learning, setting a goal to focus on python for web
        development may not necessarily be relevant to your goal of applying
        python to machine learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        You must always consider the relevancy of your goal to the bigger
        picture.
      </p>

      <h2>Five – Time-based goals</h2>

      <p>
        If you’ve learned anything from time boxing, then it should be the
        relevance of setting deadlines for specific tasks you want to achieve
        and defining them within time boxes. The same knowledge is applied here.
        For you to complete your goal definition, you must assign a reasonable
        timeframe to your goal in the order that you want it to be completed.
        What this does is to create a sense of urgency accompanied by motivation
        to complete the task in due time.
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://images.app.goo.gl/FST4AafbU5ZN6dKJ8"
        alt="Time-based Goals"
      />

      <p>
        For example, when defining your specific goal for your Tech start-up,
        you could say something in the lines of ‘For the knowledge and skill in
        the different niches that I have clearly defined to attain, I will aim
        to complete all the necessary materials and training in a month,
        assigning each week for each niche, and setting 3 hours in my day to see
        to this’. You could go further to state the specific time of the day you
        want to dedicate to achieving your goals.
      </p>

      <br /><br /><br />

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        SMART is a very effective method to see that those goals of yours do not
        go unachieved. It practically sets you up for success by providing you
        with Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals.
        If you have discarded this method then it’s time to bring it back
        because you’re heading nowhere without it while your goals are waiting
        to be accomplished.
